# What is this?

I've put off organizing `rmarkdown` documents into a blog for far too long. Initially, the objective for this repository of blurbs is to publish tutorials, exploratory analyses, and statistical modeling exercises. More often than not, the data used will be sports or stock market related. I created this blog using the `blogdown` package. 

# A section about me

Hi, my name is Jake Waddle. I live in Fort Smith, Arkansas with my wife and two little golden nuggets of joy. Joshua is our little boy, and Emma is our (big) girl. 

Out of school, I worked near Fort Smith for a company that attempted to disrupt the ceramic proppant game in the oil and gas sector. I started by cleaning and running equipment in the manufacturing plant but quickly moved into our quality control lab. When we began trialing our product in the field, I spent the better part of 2 years flying out to Midland, Texas where we did real-time quality tests on-site. Eventually I moved on to Chesapeake Energy where I spent nearly 7 years in Oklahoma City at the corporate campus. In July of 2019, we were blessed to be able to move our family back home to Fort Smith. Currently, I work at Firebend as a data scientist in our Fort Smith office.
