      <description>Los Angeles Chargers FandomI have been a Chargers fan for 20 years. Now that that’s out of the way can you think of a team, during the last few years, that has blown leads or made near-comebacks at the rate that this franchise has? It seems as if every other game winds up dwindling down to one possession. It’s been written about with some frequency that this team finds a way to grind out a close loss.</description>
