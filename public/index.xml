      <description>Los Angeles Chargers FandomI have been a Chargers fan for 20 years. Now that that’s out of the way can you think of a team, during the last few years, that has blown leads or made near-comebacks at the rate that this franchise has? It seems as if every other game winds up dwindling down to one possession. It’s been written about with some frequency that this team finds a way to grind out a close loss.</description>

      <description>What is this? I&amp;rsquo;ve put off organizing rmarkdown documents into a blog for far too long. Initially, the objective for this repository of blurbs is to publish tutorials, exploratory analyses, and statistical modeling exercises. More often than not, the data used will be sports or stock market related. I created this blog using the blogdown package.

      <description>Warmish WelcomeFantasy sports are a passion of mine because they reside at the intersection of two of my favorite things in the world: sports and data. Over the last 4 or so years, I have built data sets suitable for modeling fantasy football and basketball outcomes. I tend to favor daily fantasy, but weather data is valuable for season long fantasy football as well.
In fantasy football, weather data are valuable for a variety of reasons.</description>
