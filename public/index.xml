      <description>A Good Way to LoseAs a Chargers fan for 20+ years, the last 5ish years have been interesting to say the least. In some ways it has been comical watching coach after coach lead Philip Rivers to an endless line of close defeats.

I tend to favor daily fantasy, but weather data is valuable for season long fantasy football as well.
In fantasy football, weather data are valuable for a variety of reasons.</description>
